# 💳 Bank Management System & ATM Simulator

A **Java-based Bank Management System** combined with an **ATM Simulator**, designed to replicate core banking operations with a user-friendly desktop interface and modern biometric login using face recognition.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is developed as part of my BCA curriculum to demonstrate practical skills in:

- Java Swing & AWT GUI design
- Database integration using MySQL
- Biometric authentication using OpenCV (planned)
- Secure banking operations simulation

The system operates similar to a real-world ATM, supporting multiple transactions, account management, and user authentication with a clean blue & white themed interface.

## ✅ Key Features

- **Account Opening** — Register new users with secure data validation.
- **Face Registration** — Capture and store user face data for biometric login.
- **Face Login** — Log in securely using facial recognition.
- **Deposit & Withdrawal** — Perform core ATM transactions.
- **Mini Statement** — Generate & view transaction history.
- **PIN Change** — Securely change ATM PIN.
- **Modern UI** — Simple, classy design using Swing and AWT.
